<h2>Using iron to Encapsulate Cookies</h2>
<div>
Eran Hammer has recently created iron, a cryptographic procedure and tool to seal arbitrary data in a way so that it cannot be read and also cannot be changed without being noticed. Besides its intended use in combination with Oz it can also be used in other scenarios. One of them being encapsulated HTTP cookies. While it is in no way a new thing to pass state to Web clients in encrypted form so they...<br />

<h2>Beyond OAuth</h2>
<div>
Eran Hammer’s noisy departure from OAuth 2 woke me up to finally engage in that HTTP security investigation that had been buried in my todo list for years. Thanks a bunch for that, Eran! Starting from close-to-zero security knowledge it took some time to understand the points he is making but finally it all came together: Yep - sadly he’s spot on with his criticism. If in doubt, look at the OAuth 2.0 Threat Model...<br />

<h2>Getting Started Playing Around with JAX-RS 2.0 in an EE Container</h2>
<div>
Trying out the latest JAX-RS API advancements in an EE container is a bit of a pain because pulling in the latest JAX-RS 2.0 libraries into a Java EE environment creates conflicts with the EE-shipped JAX-RS version. Ah yes, and of course you want your IDE to pick up the correct libs for code completion. After trying and tweaking a bit the most workable solution for me was to download the latest Glassfish 4 build....<br />

<h2>JAX-RS 2.0 MVC</h2>
<div>
It is not unusual for services that expose a technical REST API to also need human-targeted UI for configuration, status checks or reporting. What I have seen a couple of times is that developers naturally use some form of REST framework (for example JAX-RS) for the technical API but then make use of yet another API technology (for example Spring or JSF) for the human-targeted UI. This not only increases the technology mix (something I...<br />

<h2>Declarative Cache Control with JAX-RS 2.0</h2>
<div>
UPDATE: The Maven/IDE setup below turned out not to work properly in all cases. Try this for better results. The final release of JAX-RS 2.0 is nearing. Time for a closer look at the new features. As JAX-RS 2.0 isn’t yet part of any standard release, some up front work is inevitable. Fortunately, Marek has some excellent write ups to get us started using the JAX-RS 2.0 reference implementation Jersey 2. I am currently working...<br />
