<h1>Classification of HTTP-based APIs</h1>

<p>
This table provides a classification of HTTP-based APIs.
The classification achieves an explicit differentiation
between the various kinds of uses of HTTP and provides a foundation to
analyse and describe the system properties induced.
</p>
<p>
Providing distinct names for the API 'styles' overcomes the useless situation
where APIs are named 'RESTful' and 'not so RESTful','almost RESTful', or 'unRESTful'.
An API either adheres to REST's interface constraints or it does not and if it does not, there
is no sense in referring to 'REST' in the API's name. Especially so because mentioning
REST might cause the false impression that the achieved system would share
the same system properties as RESTful systems.
</p>
<p>
<b>They do not</b> - and it is important to understand that the system being designed
might not have the expected properties. For example, caching and
visibility can be ruined by tunneling operations though action names in URIs.
</p>
<p>
The most important distinction to be made today is the one between the two HTTP-based API kinds
<b>HTTP-based Type I</b> and <b>HTTP-based Type II</b> on the one hand and <b>REST</b> on the other hand.
The former two, while not RESTful due to their violation of the hypermdia constraint,
can be a reasonable design choice if the tight coupling they induce is acceptable for the
given system. This might be the case if the expected life time of the system does not
warrant the considerable work of designing a proper media type.
</p>
<p>
However, it must be explicitly understood that both API kinds, 'HTTP-based Type I' and
'HTTP-based Type II' lead to systems in which clients and servers are coupled by
their original design and that the evolvability properties of RESTful systems are
in no way induced.
</p>
<p>
Helping to understand these trade-offs is the goal of the following table.

<h1>Effect on System Properties and Cost</h1>

<p>
The architectural constraints that constitute the REST style induce certain desired system properties
into a conforming architecture. When any of these constraints are (accidentally or deliberately) removed
in a given system, that system will not have the same system properties as a RESTful system. 
</p>
<p>
In order to understand the effect of removing a certain interface constraint the following table provides
an overview of the impact upon selected <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3">system properties</a>.
</p>
<p>
Removing constraints can reduce start-up cost which in
some scenarios might be of more concern than long-term maintenace- or evolution cost.
The right hand side columns of the table place the impact of removing constraints
into an overall context of start up-, maintenance- and evolution cost.

<h1>Immediate Conclusions</h1>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>WS-*</i> and <i>RPC URI-Tunneling</i> are the worst approaches
from a benefits/effort ratio point of view.
The lack of best practices makes <i>RPC URI-Tunneling</i>
considerably worse. Basically, a designer/developer can
just go off and go wild.</li>
<li>The start-up cost of <i>HTTP-based Type I</i> APIs is actually smaller than the one of <i>RPC URI-Tunneling</i>, mostly
because the former leverages HTTP mechanisms (methods, failure model, caching). 
There is no justification whatsoever to apply <i>RPC URI-Tunneling</i> - always at least use <i>HTTP-based Type I</i>.
</li>
<li>Depending on the degree to which existing media types apply to the
problem domain <i>HTTP-based Type II</i> should be considered over <i>HTTP-based Type I</i> because the
start-up cost is almost identical. A transition from <i>HTTP-based Type II</i> to REST at a later point in time, however,
is rather easy (from the server side point of view).</li>
<li>Turning a <i>HTTP-based Type II</i> API into a REST API might be as easy as deleting the API documentation.</li>
<li>If you are to any degree concerned with long term maintenance- and evolution cost
(which any enterprise IT system owner will need to be), REST is the
best solution despite the start-up cost.  The start-up cost will amortize in the long run.</li>

roughly RPC URI-Tunneling with a single endpoint, aka home-grown WS-*. </li>

<li>Add service instance examples for REST examples (Felipe Gaúcho).</li>
<li>Impact analysis on developer satisfaction</li>
