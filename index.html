    title: Rust
    desc: We think Rust hits a sweet spot between efficiency, productivity, and joy of use. For us, it is the language of choice for most situations, especially because it provides rather painless control over low level concerns and brings with it the best asynchronous IO / reactive implementation available today. If you want to learn about what Rust has to offer for developing highly performant solutions, reducing cloud infrastructure cost, or IoT projects, lets us know. We can help your team reduce Rust's rather steep learning curve.

    title: Go
    desc: For small prototypes or when some task becomes unwieldy in shell scripting, we like Go as a language with extreme productivity and a very short learning curve.
  - logo: /images/scala-logo.png
    title: Scala
    desc: Functional programming provides a great way for modeling complex business problems with high accuracy. Scala is our language of choice if Rust's functional support falls short of what we aim to do. With Akka or Finagle, Scala also provides great async/reactive support.

    title: REST
    desc: We have been active in the REST community since the very beginning and over 10 years of experience in applying Web architecture to enterprise integration scenarios. We help your development teams and architects to leverage the full potential of REST/HTTP for API design or highly efficient Web infrastructures.
  - icon: cloud
    title: Cloud
    desc: Cloud infrastructure and services have characteristics that impose a number of demands on digital products when moving to the cloud. Whether your approach is "lift and shift" or greenfield in the cloud, we help you define the best strategy and avoid any pitfals.
  - icon: globe
    title: Distributed Systems
    desc: Understanding the challenges of distributed systems is essential for engineering modern software systems. We help development teams to succeed in scenarios, where services and data needs to span across continents or the globe.


cloud_services:
  - icon: cloud
    title: Cloud Strategy Consulting
    desc: Moving parts or all of your business to the cloud involves making decisions that have a mid- to long term impact on your organisation. We can help you understand possible decision options and their implications and refine your cloud strategy so that it matches your mid- to long term business goals.
  - icon: cogs
    title: Platform Development
    desc: Cloud computing provides the opportunity to leverage synergetic effects across larger numbers of development teams. Centralizing activities that otherwise need to be done by each team yields an efficiency gain, reduces potential for bugs and can act as an abstraction that reduces vendor- or product lock-in effects. 
  - icon: gear
    title: Developing for the Cloud
    desc: The cloud brings with it a number of challenges, such as much reduced availability guarantees or the distribution of algorithms and data across in general larger numbers of smaller nodes. We help development teams to create proper system designs and understand interaction- and data modeling patterns for the prevalent PaaS-level products of the major cloud vendors.

  - title: SRE Team Enabeling
    image: /images/sre.jpg
    desc: If you are planning to introduce Site Reliability Engineering to your organisation? We help you to pick the most suitable SRE approach and to enable the prospect SRE teams. We also assist with introducing the SRE concept to management and agile development teams as an extension of the devops mindset.

    desc: "At the end of the day it is unavoidable: someone must answer the pager at night if an alert goes off. We organise efficient site operations on your behalf if it is not feasible for you (yet) to build an in-house SRE team."

  - title: Error Budget Consulting
    image: /images/errorbudget.jpg
    desc: A corner stone of successful SRE is to define optimal availability objectives for features and services. We help your product owners to develop an understanding of how to define suitable and realistic service level objectives, and how to leverage them for work priorisation using the error budget methodology.

    desc: The more reliable digital products are, the fewer site reliability engineers are neccessary, leaving more highly skilled resources for feature development. We train your development teams in reliable systems design.

      Fast experimentation and short time to market are the essence of successful digital market leadership.
      Customer's immersion in technology opens up opportunities for creation of preveiously unknown experiences.
      <p>
      However, the required high level of agility puts pressure on software quality, often leading to a drop in productivity after early praise.
      </p>
      <p>
      <i>Solutions Engineering</i> is an approach towards shaping an engineering culture for digital product
      development. It helps you to maintain the ability to experiment and innovate at manageable risk.
