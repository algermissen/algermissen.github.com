title: Is Fowler a RESTafarian?
---
{% include JB/setup %}

While giving parts of Martin Fowler's [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) another close read, I came accross this subtle sentence (from Service Layer Pattern; p. 135/136):

> [...] many of the use cases in an enterprise application are fairly boring "CRUD" (create, read,update, delete) use cases on domain objects - create one of these, read a collection of those, update this other thing. My experience is that there is almost allways a one-to-one correspodence between CRUD use cases and Service Layer operations.

That's a pretty strong argument for REST's uniform interface in an EA context I'd say.
