title: Don't Assume a Closed World
---
{% include JB/setup %}

While digging around for description logics (as with OWL DL) vs. deductive databases (as with Datalog) material I found this lucid explanation of the [Closed World Assumption](http://web.archive.org/web/20070607164326/http://esw.w3.org/topic/ClosedWorldAssumptions):

> I see it in a pragmatic way. When you're in the open then the Open World Assumption is really, guess what, the only sane thing to do. You dont really give your apartment key to a stranger because googling him up found no pages where he/she was mentioned as a criminal.
